Sexual health is fundamental to the overall health and well-being of individuals, couples and families, and to the social and economic development of communities and countries. ***Sexual health, when viewed affirmatively, requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence.*** The ability of men and women to achieve sexual health and well-being depends on their:

* access to comprehensive, good-quality information about sex and sexuality;
* knowledge about the risks they may face and their vulnerability to adverse consequences of unprotected sexual activity;
* ability to access sexual health care;
* living in an environment that affirms and promotes sexual health.
