Health accounts are a way for countries to **monitor health spending across multiple streams**, regardless of the entity or institution that financed and managed that spending. The system generates consistent and comprehensive data on health spending in a country, which in turn can contribute to evidence-based policy making. *Understanding the details of health spending is essential and allows countries to improve their systems, ultimately to make them fairer and better serve the people. **Health accounts help to protect people from catastrophic health bills and reduce inequalities in health.** They are seen as an essential step in creating a **universal health coverage system**.*
