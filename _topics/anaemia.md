Anaemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells or the haemoglobin concentration within them is lower than normal. Anaemia is a serious global public health problem that particularly affects young children and pregnant women. WHO estimates that 42% of children less than 5 years of age and 40% of pregnant women worldwide are anaemic. One-third of all women of reproductive age are anaemic.
