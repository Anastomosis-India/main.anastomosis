Health care **ethics** (aka “**medical ethics**” or “bioethics”), at its simplest, is a set of **moral** principles, beliefs and values that guide us in making choices **about medical** care. At the core of health care **ethics** is our sense of right and wrong and our beliefs about rights we possess and duties we owe others.
