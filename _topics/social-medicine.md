The field of **social medicine** seeks to implement social care through 

1. understanding how social and economic conditions impact health, disease and the practice of medicine and 2. 2. fostering conditions in which this understanding can lead to a healthier society.

The **major emphasis on biomedical science in medical education,[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_medicine#cite_note-2) health care, and medical research** has resulted into *a gap with our understanding and acknowledgement of far **more important social determinants of public health and individual disease: social-economic inequalities, war, illiteracy, detrimental life-styles (smoking, obesity), discrimination because of race, gender and religion.***
