**Gender** refers to the characteristics of women, men, girls and boys that are socially constructed. Gender is hierarchical and produces **inequalities** that intersect with other social and economic inequalities. **Gender-based discrimination** intersects with other factors of discrimination, such as ethnicity, socioeconomic status, disability, age, geographic location, gender identity and sexual orientation, among others. This is referred to as ***intersectionality***. 

***Gender interacts with but is different from sex**, which refers to the different biological and physiological characteristics of females, males and intersex persons, such as chromosomes, hormones and reproductive organs.* **Gender and sex are related to but different from gender identity**. Gender identity refers to a person’s deeply felt, internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond to the person’s physiology or designated sex at birth.

*Gender inequality and discrimination faced by women and girls puts their health and well-being at risk.*  **Women and girls often face greater barriers than men and boys to accessing health information and services.** These barriers include ***restrictions on mobility; lack of access to decision-making power; lower literacy rates; discriminatory attitudes of communities and healthcare providers; and lack of training and awareness amongst healthcare providers and health systems of the specific health needs and challenges of women and girls.***

Harmful gender norms – especially those related to ***rigid notions of masculinity – can also affect boys and men’s health and wellbeing negatively.*** For example, *specific notions of masculinity may encourage boys and men to smoke, take sexual and other health risks, misuse alcohol and not seek help or health care. **Such gender norms also contribute to boys and men perpetrating violence – as well as being subjected to violence themselves.*** **They can also have grave implications for their mental health.** 

**Rigid gender norms** also negatively affect ***people with diverse gender identities***, who often face **violence, stigma and discrimination as a result, including in healthcare settings.** ***Consequently***, they are at higher risk of ***HIV and mental health problems, including suicide.***
