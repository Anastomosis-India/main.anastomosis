Leadership and governance involves ensuring strategic policy frameworks exist and are combined with effective oversight, coalition-building, regulation, attention to system-design and accountability. Three main categories of stakeholders who interact with each other determine the health system and its governance:  

* the State (government organizations and agencies at central and sub-national level);
* the health service providers (different public and private for and not for profit clinical, para-medical and non-clinical health services providers; unions and other professional associations; networks of care or of services);
* the citizen (population representatives, patients’ associations, CSOs/NGOs, citizens associations protecting the poor, etc.) who become service users when they interact with health service providers.
