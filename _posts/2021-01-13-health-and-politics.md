According to the **WHO**, health is defined as a *state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.* The absence of a disease or symptoms does not guarantee happiness or complete health.\
\
**What can a doctor do in order to ensure complete wellbeing?**\
\
*Disease is caused by biopsychosocial causes* (The **Biopsychosocial Model of Health and Illness** proposed by **George Engel, 1977**). So, the presence of a particular disease or symptom may not be due to physical reasons alone. It might be the manifestation of longstanding social and mental issues. An ideal doctor is not the one who makes the diagnosis based on the physical symptoms alone. **Communication** with the patient is important. We cannot achieve the goal of complete wellbeing if we are focused only on the physical causes of an illness. To make a proper diagnosis, a doctor should converse with the patient, about his/her social situation and mental stresses. For example, if a patient is the only source of income in the family, and in conversation appears to be under stress due to his/her family losing its income source, appropriate psychological help should be provided the patient in order to help the patient to manage the stress properly and focus on getting better. Doctors have far greater reach into the lives of the common people than politicians, IAS officers, or other officials in the field of social service. The key to the goal of complete wellbeing is communication and **empathy**.

**Rudolf Virchow**, the pioneer who said that all cells arise from pre-existing cells, once told, "*Medicine is social science and politics is nothing more than medicine on a large scale*." This quote exemplifies the true meaning of medicine. It is not a science that can be learnt from books alone, rather it is a social science which can only be practiced if we have thorough understanding of the society we live in, and the mental and social state of the patient.

In an ideal society, all individuals are supposed to talk for the rights of the lesser privileged and marginalized sections of the society. For a doctor, this duty becomes much more important, as the doctor is the person who knows how they can be helped in order to provide them upliftment towards equity. As the people who see others in their bad times, doctors should do their best to understand them and help them to pass through their awful times, by giving them mental support as required. We should speak up for the people who are lesser privileged, and support the better cause, always. It is the politics of health.

*The profession is medical, the goal is, being humane.*
