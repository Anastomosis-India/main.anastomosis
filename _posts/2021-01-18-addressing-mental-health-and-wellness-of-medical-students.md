We all are well-known about the Hippocrates oath, an oath of ethics historically taken by physicians swearing by several healing gods, to uphold specific ethical standards.

However, when we embark on our medical journey, we unofficially sign a contract that goes far beyond the Hippocrates oath, it crammed with clauses – sacrificing your sleep to 3 hours for an exam, substituting parle-g biscuits for breakfast as your late to class, spending a vacation in your hostel instead of meeting your family, preparing presentations while your friends go out for parties and dedicating a huge portion out of your life to learning and training your medical skills.

These challenges are inevitable but aren’t we humans too? Other than learning about the anatomy of the thorax, we also have interests outside of medicine, people that we love that we also have to take care of, and a responsibility to both ourselves and others to stay physically and mentally healthy.

At some point in this journey, we might experience extreme burnouts, stress, mental breakdowns, etc. The overarching sentiment seems to be that we are always being asked to do more with less, that we are providing a commodity rather than a service, and that our efforts are never fully appreciated.

Taking care of your wellness is nothing but doing justice to yourself. You are in charge of your happiness. You know your needs better than anyone else, and if you ignore them, you haven’t done anybody, including yourself, any favors in the long term.

Keeping your wellness as your priority doesn’t have to be time-devouring. An 8-minute yoga in the morning, a small dance after completing your assignment, listening to music when you're going for a walk, talking to your childhood best friend every week, or going to the park instead of a library. Whatever, small or big, to keep you connected to yourself.

Human minds reckon for compliments. A small pat on the back for cleaning your room or completing your journal is likely to improve your mood. Likewise, build rewards into your life. When it seems, you can always do more, it’s important to acknowledge what you have accomplished.

Along those lines, nurture your relationships with your family and friends. Although relationships take effort, they also provide you with the fuel you need to keep going when you’ve exhausted your supply. A small effort to bring a big smile to your face.

At the end of the day, you are who you are. There will be burnouts but keep your eyes on the bigger picture. Always.
