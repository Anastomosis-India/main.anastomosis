Robotics when in incorporated into medicine can create wonders. One such astonishing innovation is the Da Vinci surgical robot. Da Vinci procedures are performed for a wide range of conditions under cardiac, gynaecology, paediatric, urology specialisations. 

The creators are world renowned experts in minimal invasive surgery as well as robotics. This masterpiece ensures great precision, reason being is the deviceâ€™s ability to translate the surgeons hand movements in real time. The wrist like instruments attached to the robot moves like the human hand but in greater range of motion ensuring the best results. 

A few years back the Da Vinci creators had uploaded a video on YouTube where the doctors performed a surgery on a grape. The purpose of the video was to demonstrate the accuracy of the robot even while operation on delicate skin of the grapes. This video had taken the digital world by a storm and had become the talk of the town. 

However, this so-called revolutionary machine has its own set of drawbacks. A single da Vinci surgical robot cost about 2 million USD which makes it unaffordable in many hospitals especially of the developing and underdeveloped countries. One of the other drawbacks to be emphasised is about social stigma such a robotic machine develops in the society. Many people are reluctant to go under the knife especially when the knife is held by a robot. They fear a single technical glitch in the robot could cost them their lives.
