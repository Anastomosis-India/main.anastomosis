##### **Analyse...**

How often have you felt the need to get out of a party just so you could have a little quiet time with no people around?

Have you ever come up with different things you could have said or done by continuously running a situation in your brain that has already happened in the past? (*"I shouldn't have slammed the car door that hard. Hope she didn't feel bad about me doing that!"*)

Have you ever felt that you are great at talking to a person one-on-one but the moment you step into a discussion you feel lost or uncomfortable? (*"What are they talking about? I have a valid point to present but should I? Will I be interrupting them? I should just leave!"*)

If you were asked to go up to a total stranger and strike up a conversation would you feel flustered and start rehearsing what you would say to that person?

(*Instead of having a conversation with real people, me having a conversation with my socially anxious brain on how to start a discussion*

*"Me: Hi!* 

*My* socially anxious brain: *No*

*Me: Hey!*

*My* socially anxious brain: *No*

*Me: How you doin'?*

*My* socially anxious brain: *Ummm...* 

*Me: Never mind!")*

Chances are you have social anxiety. It is a rather common condition.

About 75% of people experience the first symptoms in their childhood or early teens. The usual causes for this condition can be the fear of being judged, accidentally offending someone, being humiliated or even being the center of attention (*being the center of attention is great until you start overthinking and finding out the ways in which people might mistake you or your intentions*).
In some cases, the reason can be genetic. If you have a family member who has "social phobia" or social anxiety, chances are you might have it too. Your condition might also be a resultant of an overactive amygdala (fear is controlled by this part of our brain.)

A person suffering from social anxiety can show symptoms like having problems talking to strangers, speaking in public (it's a common fear but when your fear takes over and you can't remember the rest of your speech it's not a joyride anymore), making eye contact, eating in front of other people (ever choked on your meal while eating in front of other people? Spoiler alert! It's not fun), going to school or work or even starting conversations.

When put into a social situation  you may have experienced rapid heartbeat, inability to breath properly, dizziness and, in severe cases, stomach pain and diarrhoea. You may worry over the upcoming social event for weeks and then spend a lot of energy and time thinking about the ways that you could have reacted. People with social anxiety often shy away from small talk and social settings, and it sometimes even affects their personal relations and work life. Depression and low self esteem can also be a result of severe social anxiety. Sensitivity to criticism and negative thoughts are no positives either.

Since it is a commonly seen condition there must be simple ways to overcome it.

• ***Remember to breathe***

Often the dizziness you feel is because of improper breathing. Concentrating on your breathing technique helps with this.(you might seem like a crazy person when you are doing this in public but trust me, it doesn't matter. The crazier you seem, the better!)

• ***Relax your muscles***

Stretch your muscles and then relax them. Focus on the relaxation part. Even jogging helps to reduce the anxiety. Yoga and meditation always works (personally speaking, it's the perfect way!)

• ***Use sensory inputs that comfort you***

Play your favorite track , smell something that soothes you (lavender, vanilla etc.), chew a piece of gum or hold hands with your friend or your parent.

Next time you are going in for a big presentation or even a small party, prepare for the things you feel might trigger your anxiety. Remember to focus on the matter instead of obsessing about how you look and what people would think about you. Focus on listening to others around you. Everyone loves a good listener. Do away with any negative thoughts with positive insights.

And most of all, believe in yourself. It might not be shyness but with a little bit of effort, things can go your way.
